# ManufacturingAuctionRegression
Regression Case Study Project on Manufacturing Auction Sale Data
You can access the original data here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers

The brunt of what's interesting in this project is in the Presentation.ipynb file. This was a team coding
challenge, prepared in just under 3 hours. This repository includes ideas from teammates but all the code is my own.

The data is zipped and will need to be unzipped to run this code on your machine.
